# Computer Networks

- A computer Netowrk is a system , where two or more devices are connected to each other to share data / resources or information

## Few important keywords 

- NETWORK  --> Colleection of interconnected devices .
- NODE --> Send / forwards /receives data in a network .
- NETWORKING DEVICES --> Routers , Switches , Hubs , Access Point
- TRANSMISSION MEDIA --> Used to transfer data [ can be wired or wireless]
- WIRED MEDIA --> Ethernet cables , Optical fibres
- WIRELESS MEDIA --> WIFI ,Bluethooth , Infrared
- SAERVICE PROVIDER --> Network offered by ecternal services 
- FIREWALL --> It is a software ir hardware which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic
- DNS --> DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM [ Converts human readabke form to ip address ]
- DHCP --> DYNAMIC HOST CONFIGURATION PROTOCOL [ Automatically assigns IP address]
- UNICAST --> ONE TO ONE
- MULTICAST --> MANY TO MANY
- BROADCAST --> ONE TO MANY
- MAC --> MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL
- NIC --> NETWORK INTERFACE CARD
- IP --> INTERNET PROTOCOL
- ICMP --> INTERNET CONTROL MESSAGE PROTOCOL
- TCP --> TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL
- UDP --> USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL

## Types of topologies

- BUS --> All devices are connected to single cable 
- RING --> Devices are connected in a circular way
- MESH --> Every device is connected to every other device
- STAR --> All devices are connected to a central hub or switch


# OSI MODEL

- OSI stands for open system interconnection

- PHYSICAL  ----> PLEASE
- DATALINK  ----> DO
- NETWORKING ---> NOT
- TRANSPORT ----> THROW
- SESSION ----> SAUSAGE
- PRESENTATION ---> PIZZA
- APPLICATION ----> AWAY

- PHYSICAL LAYER --> HUBS , REPEATERS -> TRNASFER DATA IN THE FORM OF BITS -> USES PHYSICAL MEDIA .
- DATALINK LAYER --> WORKS INSIDE LAN -> MAKES SURE DATA REACHES RESPECTIVE MAC ADDRESS --> SWITCHES , NIC .
- NETWORK LAYER --> MOVES DATA BTW DIFFERENT NETWORKS USING IP ADDRESS -> IPV4 , IPV6 , ICMP .
- TRANSPORT LAYER --> Makes sure the data being sent reaches the destination -> TCP , UDP .
- SESSION LAYER --> KEEPS TRACKS OF START , END OF COMMUNICATION AND MAINTAIN THE SESSION .
- PRESENTATION LAYER --> ENCRYPTS/ DECRYPTS THE SECURITY .
- APPLICATION LAYER --> WHAT THE USER SEE -> EMAIL, WEBSITE ETC .


# TCP / IP PROTOCOL

- TCP -->TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL

- TCP /IP MODEL IS CURRENLTY IN USE AS IT WAS DEVELOPED BEFORE OSI 
- OSI IS STILL USED FOR DEBUGGING AS WE GET DETAILED INFORMATION OF WHATS HAPPENING BTW LAYERS

- TCP/IP Has 4 layers

- Network Interface (combines Physical + Data Link of OSI)
- Internet Layer (same as OSI Network layer, handles IP)
- Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)
- Application Layer (combines OSIâ€™s Application + Presentation + Session)

## PROCESS IN TCP/IP

- So when data trasfer from application to Transport it is converted to SEGMENT [ L4 HEADER ,TCP or UDP , destination Port ]
- SEGMENT  movess from transport to internet , it becomes PACKET [ L4 + L3 HEADER IS ADDEDD Which has IPV4 / IPV6]
- from internet to network , FRAME [ DESTINATION MAC ADDRSS + CHECKSUM To detect errors]

- At the end physical layer , where data is converted into 0's and 1's
