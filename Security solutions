================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================


## INTRODUCTION

- Security Information and Event Management system (SIEM) is the core security solution that a SOC analyst uses in the security operations center


## logs Everywhere, Answers Nowhere

- Multiple devices in a network communicate with each other and, most of the time, with the Internet through a router

- These devices continuously generate logs of the activities that occur within them

- These logs are divided into types such as  :
    
    - Host-Centric Log Sources .
        - These log sources capture events that occurred within or related to the host
        - A user accessing a file
        - A user attempting to authenticate.
        - A process execution activity
        - A process adding/editing/deleting a registry key or value.
        - PowerShell execution


    - Network-Centric Log Sources
        - Network-related logs are generated when the hosts communicate with each other or access the internet to visit a website
        - SSH connection
        - A file being accessed via FTP
        - Web traffic
        - A user accessing the company's resources through VPN.
        - Network file sharing Activity


- Now tons of logs are generated and all of these have issues to be noted such as :

    - Numerous Log Sources
    - No Centralization
    - Limited Context
    - Limited Analysis
    - Format issues


1) Is Registry-related activity host-centric or network-centric?
=> host-centric

2) Is VPN-related activity host-centric or network-centric?
=> NETWORK-CENTRIC



## WHY SIEM ?

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a security solution that collects logs from various types of log sources, standardizes their format into a consistent one, correlates them, and detects malicious activities using detection rules.

- Features provided by SIEM :
    - Centralized Log Collection => ALL LOGS AT ONE CENTRALIZED LOCATION
    - Normalization of Logs => SAME FORMAT FOR ALL LOGS
    - Correlation of LogS => It links different logs to find if its malicious or no
    - Real-time Alerting => DETECT MALICIOUS ACTIVITIES USING BASED ON SET OF RULES
    - Dashboards and Reporting => Lets us know about malicious activities, where is it caused, why and what actions can be taken 


## Log Sources and Ingestion

### LOG SOURCES :

    - WINDOWS LOGS => Stored in/available are ` EVENT VIEWER `

    - LINUX MACHINE =>  
        - `/var/log/httpd`: Contains HTTP Request  / Response and error logs.
        - `/var/log/cron`: Events related to cron jobs are stored in this location.
        - `/var/log/auth.log and /var/log/secure`: Stores authentication-related logs.
        - `/var/log/kern`: This file stores kernel-related events.

    - Web Server
        - FOR LINUX => `/var/log/httpd` OR `  /var/log/apache  `


### Log Ingestion

- all these logs have wealth if information and  help identify security issues

    - Agent / Forwarder : it is configured to capture and send all the important logs to the SIEM server.

    - Syslog => Used to collect real time data and send to centralized location

    - Manual Upload => We can upload logs which we had it and then analyze it offline

    - Port-Forwarding => SIEM solutions can also be configured to listen on a certain port


1) In which location within a Linux environment are HTTP logs stored?
=> var/log/httpd




## Alerting Process and Analysis

- SIEM solution has detection rules that catch threat

- These rules play an important role in the timely detection of threats, allowing analysts to take action on time



1) Which Event ID is generated when event logs are removed?
=> 104

2) What type of alert may require tuning?
=> FALSE POSITIVE
